# Analytics Methodology and problem solving frameworks 
## Date: 26th Sept, 2021

*	Type 1: Descriptive Analytics: describe the trend, phenomenon what has happened previously (past data); no decision is being taken but it provides some insights;
    * Uses data visualization techniques to understand the past trends. EG: Most shoppers turn towards the right side when they enter a retail store so retailers keep products with higher profits on the right. Walmart discovered through data mining that the sales of diapers and beer were correlated on Friday nights. 
    * Correlation is different from causation. We can do path test to test on causation. 
    * Feature extraction is a process which we use to find which factors to take. 
*	Type 2: Predictive Analytics: what will happen in future event and reveals relationships that were previously unknown and are intuitive. 
*	Type 3: Prescriptive: finding the optimal solution to a problem or in making the right choice/decision among several alternatives. What is best action for the current business problem? 
*	Business risk can be managed in following ways: 
    * **Diversification:** Like don’t put all money in one business, don’t put all apples in one basket
    * **Insurance:** transferring risk from you 
    * Hedging: move from higher degree of risk to lower degree of risk
*	Analytics can do:
    * **Classification**: Supervised learning: Consists of examining of features of a newly presented objects and assigning it to the one of pre-defined sets. Eg, classifying credit card application as high, low, medium risk
    * **Estimation**: is calculated approximation of a continuous variable such as income, height or credit card balance which is usable even if input data may be incomplete or uncertain. 
    * **Affinity grouping**: Helps to determine which things so together. It is often used to perform market basket analysis in which retailers seek to understand the purchase behaviour of customer. 
    * **Clustering**: Unsupervised learning: is a task of segmenting a heterogeneous group of population into a number of more homogeneous sub-groups or clusters. It is example of undirected analysis and is often a prelude to some other form of modelling
    * **Summarization:** Can be done simply to describe what is going on in a complicated database that improves our understanding of the events
## Business problem framing
*	Business problem have to be framed as **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time bound and it should be KISS 
*	A business problem starts by describing a business opportunity or a threat or a n issue in broad terms. We need a business objective for which we need to find solution using analytics.
